  \begin{abstract} % abstract
    The rapid growth of chemical databases has put much burden on our
    ability to efficiently search and mine chemical structures. Even
    for modest sized chemical databases (e.g., $\approx10^6$),
    supporting full structure searching efficiently remains a
    challenging task. Herein we describe an efficient indexing
    scheme---based on inverted indices---for chemical graphs that
    enables fast structure searching. We demonstrate the utility
    and effectiveness of our approach through a self-contained
    implementation available at
    \href{https://spotlite.nih.gov/opensource/structure-indexer}%

\section*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Short background on chemical structure searching
\item Short background on inverted indices
\item Prior work on inverted indices - similarity searching
  \cite{Nasr:2012qy}, structure searching
  \cite{timvdminvertedindex:2015th}, clustering \cite{Thiel:2014ly}
\item Contributions from this paper
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Differentiate from \cite{Nasr:2012qy}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe construction of inverted index
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Using Lucene as the backend}
\label{sec:using-lucene-as}

\begin{itemize}
\item Brief background on Lucene
\item Why it is it useful to use Lucene rather than homegrown solution?
\item integrate structure search along with text/numeric search for free
\item Dalke \cite{dalkeiinvindex:2013nx} mentions use of Lucene and
  related libs
\end{itemize}

\section*{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection*{Benchmarking query performance}
\label{sec:benchm-query-perf}

\begin{itemize}
\item Query performance can mean execution time and accuracy
\item Summarize query performance as function of parameters
  \begin{itemize}
  \item fingerprint size
  \item codebook size
  \item other params?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item How could other features (distributed queries?) of lucene be leveraged? 
\end{itemize}
